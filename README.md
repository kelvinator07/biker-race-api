# Prestigious Bike Race API

Once every decade, an exciting, prestigious, and inspiring bike race takes place in Colorado at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. It's the Boulder Bike Tour, and it's coming up in 2020! The huge hype around the event means it's time to start preparing the whole event now. The organizers need a website for the event and have launched a call for proposals, meaning you will be submitting your idea for the bike tour's site!
